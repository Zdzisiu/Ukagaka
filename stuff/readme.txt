Do you like having things?
GREAT!
Me to!
Here, have some things.
I like those things.
Things are nice.
There might be more things within other things u know.
Like those Russian dolls!
Things with things inside!
Exciting, isn't it!?
There are so many things you can do with things!

Here are some warnings for the things:
- Some things are mean :(
- Don't read books with eyes on the covers (my brother might be mad if you do ._.)
- Some things are dangerous! Be careful!
- Don't let anything alive inside.
- Try not to leave anything of yours inside, you might not get it back!
- I'm not sure how many things there are so look carefully!
- Remember to feed it!
- Don't mess with the clock, I'm not fixing it if you do >:(
- Don't worry about anything you find, If it's there, it means I put it there, so it should be there!
- I'm not responsible for anything alive you bring inside, at least as long as it's still alive.
- Don't go outside!

Enjoy your stuff!
