It's a balloon! This one is meant for the Dusty ghost, and is fairly specialized to him. balloons9 is a balloon with the font set to Wingdings, for his Wingdings only mode. Also the Kero balloon is tiny, because most of the time Obsidian just meows. I don't know if I'll release this on my site or not, but if you're interested in other balloons that you can use and modify for your own ghosts, you can check out what I've got available here: https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/balloons.html

You can contact me at deviantart.com/zichqec or zichqec.tumblr.com

Many thanks to Zarla for creating the balloon template and walkthrough!
