Hey there! It's me Zar and I'm going to level with you, setting up surfaces.txt sucks. I've left a lot of commentary in the file itself, but if I were you, I'd try to follow my guidelines and just replace the images as directed. Make sure you follow my directions carefully though! Especially when it comes to the eyes/mouths.

If you've ever made a FLELE shell, that knowledge will come in handy here. HOWEVER, this ghost template is simple on purpose, so it doesn't really touch on a lot of the more complicated things you can do with surfaces.txt. You can pull off some cool things if you're determined. And of course, if you're clever, you don't have to just replace stuff, you can break new ground and do your own thing! I explain some of the tricks of surfaces.txt within the file itself, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Advanced users may want to keep them in mind though.

I wrote up some about surfaces.txt and creating images in the walkthrough, so I highly recommend reading through that before you get started.

Some more handy resources about surfaces.txt can be found where FLELE shell makers congregate, namely at shell-collectors on devart. So here are a few links to some tutorials about surfaces.txt that may come in handy, you may want to read these and then come back and tackle surfaces.txt with new ideas if you're feeling adventurous.
