LOG #2
LOG #2.0\nFinally, something interesting! Tomorrow we will be starting work on the AI in generation M-A. The atmosphere started to change little by little but for the worse it seems, the more work we get done the more stressed people become. Well, there isn't really anything I can do (even though I tried), my coworkers never talk to each other about anything outside of work/current tasks, it's kind of exhausting.

LOG #2.1\nYou could cut the tension in the air with a knife, honestly, why is everyone so stressed about a simple AI? Did they watch too much sci-fi horrors or what? It's not even a human AI, we are literally making a glorified tamagotchi.

LOG #2.2\nThe AI works, literally nothing interesting happened, everyone still seems tense and the tension went up  by 150% after one of the models displayed the incorrect serial number, it was weird but not enough for everyone to act as if the ceiling was to collapse any moment. The incorrect serial number was 017, maybe the number has some kind of weird significance?
