LOG #1.0\nMy name is Ġ̴̛̗̳̳͕̍͊d̷̤̖͗̅͜y̷̤̤̿͝l̸̺͗̕̚ͅg̵̟̺̿͊̀͝ ̷̫͉̲̎̋͠P̶̦̹̮̮͗͑r̵̓͜r̶̡̦͖͎̔ų̵̞̺̘̈́̈́̿h̷͕̋̽, I'm soon to be developer for A.R.I, I write those logs to document my work in here, it's a habit of mine I suppose. My first work day in the company starts tomorrow, I will be working on new updates and fixes for generation M-g.\n Today one of the managers showed me around my work place and introduced me to my coworkers.

\n\n[half]LOG #1.1\nToday I was working with generation M-g, software for learning language. There wasn't really anything interesting, more so the opposite, it was so uninteresting that it seemed unnatural, no problems, no small talk, even when people were constantly moving from place to place everything seemd unnaturally still, or maybe it's just like that for me? after working with Nicholas in his lab full of people with energy and new ideas.\nI Wonder how is they are doing?

\n\n[half]LOG #1.2.\nThe work today, like in the past days, was pretty uneventfull.
